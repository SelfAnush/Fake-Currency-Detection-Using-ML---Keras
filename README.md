# Fake Currency Detection with Keras

This repository contains code for training a machine learning model to detect fake currency using the Keras deep learning framework.

## Overview
Counterfeit currency poses a significant threat to financial security, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This project addresses the challenge by leveraging deep learning techniques to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit banknotes based on image features.

## Key Features
- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze texture, watermark, and security elements in currency images.
- Dataset includes labeled images of both real and counterfeit currency for model training and evaluation.
- User-friendly interface provided by Keras simplifies model development and training process.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Usage
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-currency-detection.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare dataset: Organize genuine and counterfeit currency images into respective folders.
4. Train the model: Run `train_model.py` to train the CNN on the provided dataset.
5. Evaluate the model: Use `evaluate_model.py` to assess the model's performance on test data.
6. Deploy the model: Integrate the trained model into your application for automated counterfeit detection.
